# üïµÔ∏è Real-Time Object Detection with YOLO

This project is a real-time object detection system that uses a pre-trained YOLO (You Only Live Once) model to identify and classify objects in a live video stream, such as from a webcam. It demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and deep learning, providing an impressive and tangible showcase for your portfolio. .

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Processing:** The system can process video frames at a high speed, enabling smooth, live object detection.
- **Deep Learning Model:** It leverages a pre-trained **YOLOv5** model from the Ultralytics library, a state-of-the-art model known for its balance of speed and accuracy.
- **Live Bounding Boxes:** The application draws bounding boxes and labels around detected objects directly on the video feed.
- **Robust Technology Stack:** Built on powerful libraries like **PyTorch** and **OpenCV**, which are industry standards for computer vision and deep learning.
